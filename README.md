# Audit-Agentic-AI

Fascinated by the current technology on Agentic AI. 
This project is self hosted and touches on core foundation of Agentic AI.


## Brief Introductory
Audit Agent is a tool-using AI agent designed to inspect, reason about, and safely interact with real codebases.

Unlike chatbots, it operates step-by-step using explicit tools and produces verifiable, 
auditable outputs for every action it takes.

> Core idea: nothing is asserted or changed without evidence.

## Architecture (Simple)

Plan → Tool → Observe → Verify → Repeat

## Demonstration of outcome 

- Applied AI system design

- Tool-augmented LLM reasoning

- Safety and verification mindset

- Real-world software engineering integration

- Evaluation-driven development
