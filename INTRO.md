# Core difference comparing copilot and this project

Q: “Isn’t this just like Copilot?”

A: “Copilot focuses on local code completion, while this project focuses on repository-level reasoning, verification, and safety. The agent doesn’t generate code unless it has inspected and cited the relevant source and verified the result with tools.”

Simple Terms:
--
Copilot helps you write code faster.
Audit Agent helps you trust AI in real codebases.

Simple analogy (non-technical):
--
Copilot = typing assistant
Audit Agent = junior engineer with a checklist
